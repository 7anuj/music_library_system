# music_library_system
A Music Library System using PyMySQL and Tkinter is a desktop application that allows users to add, delete, and organize songs efficiently. The system uses Tkinter for the graphical user interface (GUI) and PyMySQL to interact with a MySQL database for storing song details such as title, artist, album, genre, and duration.
